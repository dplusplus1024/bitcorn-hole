# Bitcorn Hole Gameplay Instructions 🌽🕳️
This is **Bitcorn Hole**! Normal Cornhole rules do not apply. 🤠

## Setup
- **Players:** The Red Player and Blue Player stand opposite their respective colored boards.
- **Bitcoin:** Both players input their **Lightning Address** into the game startup screen.

## Lightning Address

Here's a [quick guide](LIGHTNING.md) on how to get a Lightning Address.

## Who Goes First?
Determine the starting player by selecting either:
- The player who arrived first at the event.
- The player who traveled the farthest distance to attend.

## Gameplay
- Players alternate throws, with one bean bag per turn, aiming for the hole on the board opposite them.
- After each point is scored, the bean bag must be taken out of the hole for the game to continue.

## Scoring
Landing a bean bag in the hole earns 1 point; landing on the board earns no points. 

## Winning the Game
- The game ends once both players have collectively reached a predetermined total score (e.g., 7 points).
- The player with the highest score at the end wins, but both players enjoy instant bitcoin payments for each point.

## Disclaimer
These rules are subject to change, and this software is experimental. While rare, false negatives or false positives may occur during gameplay.

**Enjoy the game and may the best player win!** 🌽
