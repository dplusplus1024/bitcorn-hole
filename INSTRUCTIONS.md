# Bitcorn Hole Gameplay Instructions 🌽🕳️

## Setup:

## Gameplay:
Players alternate throws, with one bean bag per turn, aiming for the hole on the board opposite them.

## Scoring:
Landing a beanbag in the hole earns 1 point; landing on the board earns no points. 

## Winning the Game:
- The game ends once both players have collectively reached a predetermined total score (e.g., 7 points).
- The player with the higher score at the end wins, but both players enjoy bitcoin rewards for each point scored.
