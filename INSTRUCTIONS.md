# Gameplay Instructions 🌽🕳️

## How to Play

## Setup:
- **Players:** Red Player and Blue Player stand opposite their respective colored boards.
- **Bitcoin:** Ensure both players have their Lightning Network addresses ready.

## Who Goes First?
- Determine the starting player by selecting either:
    - who arrived first at the event.
    - Who traveled the farthest distance to attend.

## Gameplay:
- Players alternate throws, with one bean bag per turn, aiming for the hole on the board opposite them.

## Scoring:
- Landing a beanbag in the hole earns 1 point; landing on the board earns no points. 

## Winning the Game:
- The game ends when a predetermined total score (e.g., 7 points) is reached. *(This is an example; feel free to adjust the total points based on your group's preference.)*
- The player with the higher score at the end wins, but both players enjoy bitcoin rewards for each point scored.
