# Bitcorn Hole üåΩüï≥Ô∏è

**Bitcorn Hole** is a physical hardware game where players earn bitcoin every time they score a point! Beanbags are tossed into the cornhole set and detected using microcontrollers with time-of-flight sensors. Each point scored triggers an **instant** payment of sats to the player‚Äôs Lightning Address! ‚ö°

## Live Demo

To see how the game works in action, check out [this demo on Twitter](https://x.com/D_plus__plus/status/1807889900093821104).

## What You‚Äôll Need

To build your own Bitcorn Hole setup, you‚Äôll need the following:

- [Cornhole set](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07S1PYYTV) ‚Äî comes with two boards
- 2x [Wifi-enabled microcontrollers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C8V88Z9D) ‚Äî
  I used the Arduino Uno R4, but you could refactor the code to work with ESP32
- 2x [Time-of-flight (ToF) sensors](https://a.co/d/5bQHzve)
- [Jumper wires](https://www.amazon.com/California-JOS-Breadboard-Optional-Multicolored/dp/B0BRTJQZRD) and USB-C cables
- [Battery packs](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LH26PFT) or AC adapters
- DIY enclosures ‚Äî
  These are placed under each cornhole board to house the sensors and detect beanbags
- A computer with speakers to run the user-facing webpage

## Code and Setup

There are three main code files in this repository:

1. **Frontend Webpage**: This displays the game interface and real-time scoring updates.

2. **Microcontroller Code**: This is the code that runs on the microcontrollers, hosting a web server and interfacing with the ToF sensor to detect when a beanbag is present.

5. **API to Pay Sats**: This handles the instant payments to players' Lightning Addresses. You can substitute your own API endpoint, and either run your own LND node or use a service like Lightspark or ZBD.
