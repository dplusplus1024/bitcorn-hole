# Bitcorn Hole üåΩüï≥Ô∏è

**Bitcorn Hole** is a physical hardware game where players instantly receive bitcoin each time they score points. Beanbags are tossed into the cornhole set, which detects them using microcontrollers with time-of-flight sensors. Each time a player scores, they get paid sats **instantly** to their Lightning Address! ‚ö°

## Live Demo

To see how the game works in action, check out [this demo on Twitter](https://x.com/D_plus__plus/status/1807889900093821104).

## What You‚Äôll Need

To build your own Bitcorn Hole setup, you‚Äôll need the following:

- Cornhole set (2 boards)
- 2x Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors
- 2x Microcontrollers (e.g., ESP32)
- Cables
- Battery packs or AC adapters
- DIY enclosures (to place under each cornhole board for beanbag detection and to house the sensors/microcontrollers)

## Code and Setup

There are three main code files in this repository:

1. **API to Pay Sats**: This handles the instant payments to players' Lightning Addresses. You can substitute your own API endpoint, and either run your own LND node or use a service like Lightspark or ZBD.

2. **Frontend Webpage**: This displays the game interface and real-time scoring updates.

3. **Microcontroller Code**: This is the code that runs on the microcontrollers, interfacing with the TOF sensors to detect when a beanbag is scored.
