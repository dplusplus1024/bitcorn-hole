# Lightning Address

## How to get a Lightning Address
- You may already have one if you have a Lightning wallet such as Phoenix, Wallet of Satoshi, ZBD, Strike, or Coinos.
- Unfortunately, Cash App, Breez, and Muun do not support Lightning Address at this time.

## Pros and Cons 
**Strike** offers push notifications and the option to buy bitcoin, but requires KYC verification and isn't available everywhere. **Coinos** is faster to get started, works in every jurisdiction, and doesnâ€™t require KYC, but lacks the ability to buy bitcoin. **Coinos** is a [PWA](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+add+a+pwa+to+your+home+screen+safari) and not an app, but you can add it to your Home Screen on iOS in Safari.
