# Lightning Address

A Lightning Address looks like an email address (e.g. you@domain.com) and enables you to send and receive bitcoin payments instantly through the Lightning Network.

## How to get a Lightning Address
- You may already have one if you have a Lightning wallet such as Phoenix, Wallet of Satoshi, ZBD, Strike, or Coinos.
- Unfortunately Cash App, Breez, and Muun do not support Lightning Address at this time. 
- If you don't already have one, continue reading to get started.

## Pros and Cons 
**Strike** offers push notifications and the option to buy bitcoin, but requires KYC verification. **Coinos** is faster to get started and doesnâ€™t require KYC, but lacks the ability to buy bitcoin. **Coinos** a PWA and not an app, but you can it to your Home Screen on iOS in Safari.
