# Lightning Address

A Lightning Address looks like an email address (e.g. you@domain.com) and enables you to send and receive bitcoin payments instantly through the Lightning Network.

## How to get a Lightning Address
You may already have one if you have a Lightning wallet such as Phoenix, Wallet of Satoshi, ZBD, Strike, or Coinos. Unfortunately at this time, Cash App does not support Lightning Address (however, you can use entropy.page/lnurl to pay Lightning Addresses from Cash App).
