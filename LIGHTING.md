# Lightning Address

A Lightning Address looks like an email address (e.g. you@domain.com) and enables you to send and receive bitcoin payments instantly through the Lightning Network.

## How to get a Lightning Address
- You may already have one if you have a Lightning wallet such as Phoenix, Wallet of Satoshi, ZBD, Strike, or Coinos.
- Unfortunately Cash App, Breez, and Muun do not support Lightning Address at this time.

## Option 2: Coinos
